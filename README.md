## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) (required for ORB-SLAM3)
- [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) (`sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl` on Ubuntu)

### Install

Clone the repository and install the package:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/trumi.git
cd trumi
uv sync
```

This installs all dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml` into a local `.venv`.

To activate the environment manually:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Or prefix any command with `uv run` to automatically use the environment without activating it.

### ORB-SLAM3 Docker Image

The SLAM pipeline runs ORB-SLAM3 inside a Docker container.
Build the image once before running the pipeline:

See [TrossenRobotics/ORB_SLAM3 — DOCKER.md](https://github.com/TrossenRobotics/ORB_SLAM3/blob/master/DOCKER.md)
for setup instructions.

### Developer Setup (optional)

Install pre-commit hooks:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```


## Dataset Generation Pipeline

An example dataset is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TrossenRoboticsCommunity/example_trumi_dataset) to try the pipeline without recording your own data.

Download it using the [Hugging Face CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/cli) (downloads into the current directory, preserving the `example_trumi_dataset/` folder structure):

```bash
cd ~/trumi
hf download TrossenRoboticsCommunity/example_trumi_dataset \
    --repo-type dataset \
    --local-dir .
```

Before running `dataset_generation_pipeline.py`, ensure:

1. The Docker daemon is running:

```bash
docker info
```

2. Your session directory is organized with the appropriate videos:

```
<session_dir>/
└── raw_videos/
    ├── mapping.mp4               # rename your mapping video to this
    ├── gripper_calibration/      # place gripper calibration video(s) here
    │   └── *.mp4                 # one video per camera serial
    └── *.mp4                     # remaining videos are treated as demonstrations
```

Run the full pipeline with:

```bash
uv run python scripts/dataset_generation_pipeline.py <session_dir>
```

For example, using the downloaded example dataset:

```bash
uv run python scripts/dataset_generation_pipeline.py example_trumi_dataset
```

Example output (truncated to final steps):

```

```

For this dataset, 99% of the data is usable (successful SLAM), with 0 demonstrations dropped. If your dataset has a low SLAM success rate, double check if you carefully followed our [data collection instructions](#data-collection).

**Notes:**

- SLAM processes frames at a lower rate than the recorded video to ensure enough IMU samples
  accumulate between consecutive SLAM frames (minimum 3 samples/frame at 200 Hz IMU rate). For a
  120 fps recording this means SLAM runs at 60 fps (skip=2). Check the `skip` value for your
  recording from the log file produced during the mapping SLAM step
  (`<session_dir>/demos/mapping_*/slam_stdout_mapping.txt`):
  ```
  Video: 119.88 fps  |  SLAM: 59.9401 fps (skip=2)  |  IMU/frame: 3.33667
  ```
  Pass the `skip` value as `--slam_frame_stride` to `dataset_generation_pipeline.py` (and to
  `04_detect_aruco.py`, `06_generate_dataset_plan.py`, `07_generate_mcap_dataset.py`, and
  `07_generate_zarr_dataset.py` when running steps manually). The default is `2` (120 fps → 60 fps SLAM).

- To inspect intermediate results, visualization scripts are provided:

  - **SLAM trajectory** — plots the ORB-SLAM3 camera trajectory from a session's
    `camera_trajectory.csv` as a 3D path (purple = start, yellow = end):
    ```bash
    uv run python scripts/visualize_trajectory.py -t <demo_dir>/camera_trajectory.csv
    ```

  - **ArUco tag detections** — renders tag detections overlaid on the source video and writes an
    annotated MP4:
    ```bash
    uv run python scripts/visualize_aruco_video.py \
        -i <demo_dir> \
        -ci <path/to/intrinsics.json> \
        -sfs <slam_frame_stride> \
        -o <output.mp4>
    ```


## Data Collection

A dataset consists of one or more sessions. Sessions serve as distinct units of data collection, all originating from the same location. Each session includes three key components:

- A SLAM mapping video
- A gripper calibration video
- A series of task demonstration videos

### Step 0: GoPro Preparation

Install [GoPro Labs firmware](https://gopro.github.io/labs/). GoPro Labs allows setting any camera setting by scanning a QR code.

Scan the following QR code with your GoPro to apply all required camera settings:

![Camera settings QR code](assets/camera_settings_qr.jpeg)

Once the settings are saved, the GoPro screen will show **"Labs-Trumi"** with the applied configuration:

![Camera settings saved confirmation](assets/camera_settings_saved_check.jpg)

**Note:** When using with ultra-wide lens, disable auto lens detection and manually set the lens to standard (Preferences > Lens Mod > Standard). This prevents GoPro from applying additional distortion correction, ensuring raw undistorted frames are saved.

### Step 1: Timecode Sync

**Note:** This step is only required for bi-manual (two-gripper) data collection. Skip it if you are using a single gripper.

Serve the timecode sync page locally and open the printed URL in a browser, then scan the refreshing QR code using your GoPro (requires Labs firmware). Precise synchronization between the two grippers is critical for bi-manual data collection.

```bash
uv run python scripts/serve_timecode_sync.py
```

**Tip:** Adjust your distance to the QR code if you have difficulty scanning.

### Step 2: Mapping Video

<!-- TODO: add photo/video of mapping video -->

The mapping video is used by ORB-SLAM3 to build a 3D map of the environment. SLAM success rate is highly sensitive to the scene and the mapping process.

**Scene selection tips:**

- Prefer environments with enough visual texture
- Avoid large plain surfaces (white walls, bare ceilings, empty corners)

We provide the printed mapping marker — place it on the work surface and follow the mapping process carefully. Correct placement is critical for SLAM success rate.

The gripper finger identifiers are embedded in the finger mounts, so you normally do not need to print anything. Printable copies of every marker are provided in [`assets/aruco_markers/`](assets/aruco_markers/) in case you need a replacement. The physical printed size must match exactly — incorrect sizes will produce inaccurate poses and gripper widths:

| Marker | Dictionary | ID | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mapping | DICT_4X4_50 | 13 | 0.16 m |
| Gripper 0 left | DICT_4X4_50 | 0 | 0.016 m |
| Gripper 0 right | DICT_4X4_50 | 1 | 0.016 m |
| Gripper 1 left | DICT_4X4_50 | 6 | 0.016 m |
| Gripper 1 right | DICT_4X4_50 | 7 | 0.016 m |

### Step 3: Gripper Calibration Video

<!-- TODO: add photo/video of gripper calibration -->

Record a short video of opening and closing the gripper 5 times. This is used to calibrate the gripper finger tag detection.

### Step 4: Demonstrations

<!-- TODO: add photo/video of demonstration collection -->

Record *N* demonstration videos.


## Dataset Formats

The pipeline supports two output formats, selectable via `--format` (`-f`):

```bash
# MCAP (default)
uv run python scripts/dataset_generation_pipeline.py <session_dir>

# Zarr
uv run python scripts/dataset_generation_pipeline.py -f zarr <session_dir>
```

**MCAP** — One `.mcap` file per episode in a directory (`dataset_mcap/`). Each file contains time-aligned robot state, JPEG-compressed camera images, and IMU telemetry (accelerometer + gyroscope) as typed, self-describing messages. MCAP files can be inspected with [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/).

**Zarr** — A single `dataset.zarr.zip` archive containing all episodes in a flat NumPy-backed replay buffer with JpegXl-compressed images.

Both formats store per-step end-effector pose (position + axis-angle rotation), gripper width, demo start/end poses, and camera images. MCAP additionally includes raw IMU samples.


## Additional Tools

Helpers added in this fork. Run from the repository root; recordings and outputs are kept in `data/` (not versioned).

**Session quality checks** (`scripts/tools/`, TRumi environment):

- `bash scripts/tools/test_mappings.sh <out_dir> <mapping videos...>`: build a SLAM map from each mapping take
  (pipeline steps 01 + 02) and report which ones work. Prefer takes whose map starts from the marker
  (`tag_init_success=1`).
- `bash scripts/tools/eval_maps.sh <session_dir> <candidate_dirs...>`: for each candidate map, check that the
  session's demos localize in it and that the mapping-marker calibration is tight ("Tag position std" ≈ 1–2 cm).
- `uv run python scripts/tools/make_3d_video.py --session <session_dir> --episode N`: video of an episode with
  the camera views and the 3D gripper-tip paths.

**Per-session clock correction**: if the two cameras' clocks have drifted apart, put
`camera_time_offsets.json` (e.g. `{"<camera serial>": -0.073}`, seconds added to that camera's start times) in
the session directory; steps 06 and 07 apply it.

**Simulation** (`scripts/sim/`, separate MuJoCo environment; set up once with `bash scripts/sim/setup_sim.sh`):

- `data/sim/.venv/bin/python scripts/sim/view_scan.py --glb <scan.glb>`: view a phone scan (e.g. Scaniverse).
- `data/sim/.venv/bin/python scripts/sim/view_twin.py`: the scanned cell with a UR5e + Robotiq 2F-85 placed
  where the real robot stands; move the joints with the viewer's Control sliders.
- `MUJOCO_GL=egl data/sim/.venv/bin/python scripts/sim/replay_ur5e.py --session <dir> --episode N --arm right`:
  replay one TRumi arm on a simulated UR5e + 2F-85 and render it next to the GoPro view (stand-in robot
  placement; not yet calibrated to a real robot).
